# Football Across The Ages
<br/><br/>

In this project, I want to achieve the following goals/answer the following questions:

* Conduct basic exploratory analysis on some topics that interest me
  * How many games were played
  * How many countries play football competatively
  * How many tournaments are there
  * etc.
* What parts of the world are most succesful at football?
* Who are the top goal scorers of all time?
* When a team hosts a tournament, are they more succesful than when they compete in foreign-hosted tournaments?

The data was downloaded from [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=goalscorers.csv)
