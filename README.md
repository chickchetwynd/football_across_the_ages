# Hey, thanks for stopping by :handshake:

Here are some projects that I've been working on:

* [Football Across the Ages](https://github.com/chickchetwynd/portfolio/blob/main/football_across_the_ages.md)
  * My first ever project! Key skills learnt/used: SQL CTEs and Joins and Markdown formatting.
